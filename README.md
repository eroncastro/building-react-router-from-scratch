# Learning React Router

This project goal is to learn React Router from scratch.
It is based on this [awesome tutorial by Tyler McGinnis](https://tylermcginnis.com/build-your-own-react-router-v4/).
We start out by building `Route`, `Link`, and `Redirect`.

## Running

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`
